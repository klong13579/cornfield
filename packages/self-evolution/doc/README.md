# @oh-my-pi/self-evolution

Self-evolution plugin for oh-my-pi. Automatically extracts reusable skills from agent sessions, learns project conventions, detects inefficiency patterns in real time, and retrieves relevant past experiences to improve future task performance.

## Features

### Core Loop

- **Automatic skill extraction**: Identifies reusable patterns from completed sessions (rule-based + optional LLM refinement)
- **Episodic memory**: Archives session traces with full-text search (FTS5) for cross-session recall
- **Experience injection**: Injects relevant past episodes, skills, and conventions into the system prompt before each session
- **Skill versioning**: Keeps historical snapshots with rollback support and GEPA-style prompt optimization
- **Heuristic quality scoring**: 0-100 multi-dimensional evaluation (success rate, tool diversity, pitfall coverage, description quality, user rating)

### Behavioral Intelligence (v2)

- **Intent classification**: Hybrid rule/LLM classification — 9 categories (refactoring, bugfix, feature-add, testing, documentation, configuration, exploration, optimization, integration)
- **User profiling**: Incremental behavioral profile — tool frequency, tool transitions, intent distribution, error/recovery rates, preferred languages
- **Workflow mining**: Extracts reusable tool-sequence patterns from successful sessions, grouped by intent
- **Feedback tracking**: Records injection outcomes (times helped / failed) to learn which episodes are actually useful
- **Context-aware retrieval**: Multi-factor scoring — intent match (0-40), keyword match (0-30), success boost (0-15), recovery (0-5), recency (0-10), profile affinity (0-15), effectiveness feedback (0-20). Optional LLM rerank for final selection.

### Real-Time Nudge System

- **NudgeDetector**: Monitors tool execution results in real time, detects inefficiency patterns with causal root-cause attribution:
  - Cascading read-verify failures after broken edits
  - Edit-verify path mismatches
  - Search-misled read attempts
  - Error cascades (3+ consecutive failures with root-cause hints)
  - Redundant search loops (3+ consecutive searches without modification)
  - Slow loops (high tool count, no file modifications — possible spinning)
  - Read-only after write (multiple reads after last modification, suggesting verification is complete)
- **NudgeDeliverer**: Shows in-session hints with cooldown (30s) to prevent spam

### Convention System (v2.5)

- **Convention extraction**: Extracts project-specific rules from user dialogue — 5 types: `negative_rule`, `positive_rule`, `preference`, `project_fact`, `procedural_rule`
- **Convention compliance**: Heuristic checker verifies whether the agent followed injected conventions during a session (file modification checks, tool usage checks)
- **Convention feedback loop**: Tracks compliance/violation per session, surfaces violations in daily/audit reports

### Effectiveness Analysis (v2.5)

- **EffectivenessAnalyzer**: Multi-dimensional scoring of injection outcomes:
  - Explicit correction detection ("不对", "错了", "incorrect" etc.)
  - Explicit approval detection ("好的", "thanks", "perfect" etc.)
  - Redundancy via Jaccard overlap of prompts
  - Error avoidance (whether the same tools errored as in the injected episode)
  - Tool efficiency comparison
  - Success bonus
- **InjectionOutcome**: Per-episode helpfulness score [-1, 1] with 6 signal dimensions

### Reporting & Diagnostics

- **Daily Report** (`/evolution report`): Session breakdown with success/failure/empty/partial counts, top error patterns, key moments (error/recovery/success/correction), new learnings, top tools
- **Audit Report** (`/evolution audit`): System health check — episode capacity, success rate, skill quality, injection help rate, intent distribution, workflow meaningfulness, convention coverage, user profile summary, auto-generated issues and recommendations
- **Fit Evaluation** (`/evolution fit`): "懂我程度" scoring across 5 dimensions — 个人记忆留存 (memory), 思维模式适配 (thinking), 输出风格贴合 (style), 隐含需求预判 (prediction), 历史对话联动 (history). Total 0-100 with trend tracking and verdict (明显更懂我 → 明显不懂我)
- **Trace Analyzer** (v2.6): Causal tool-chain diagnosis — read failure classification, cascade pattern detection, tool efficiency metrics, cross-session trend analysis

### Agent Tools

The plugin registers three tools the LLM can call during sessions:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `query_episodic_memory` | Search past experiences by keyword (FTS5 + context-aware scoring) |
| `list_evolved_skills` | Browse the skill library with quality/deprecation filtering |
| `optimize_skill_prompt` | Run GEPA-style optimization on a skill's approach text |

## Installation

This plugin is bundled with `pi-coding-agent` and loads automatically as an inline extension. No separate installation is required.

## Learning Loop

```
User task
    |
    v
TraceRecorder captures events (tool calls, errors, messages, user prompt)
    |
    v
tool_execution_end → NudgeDetector checks for inefficiency patterns → NudgeDeliverer shows hint (if any)
    |
    v
agent_end:
  - evaluate session → archive as Episode
  - classify intent → store in episode_intents
  - mine workflow pattern → store in workflow_patterns
  - update user profile → store in user_profiles
  - extract conventions from dialogue → store in conventions
  - check convention compliance for this session → store in convention_feedback
  - if episodes were injected: analyze effectiveness → store in episode_effectiveness / skill_effectiveness
    |
    v
If significant (tool calls >= threshold): extract Skill (rule + optional LLM)
    |
    v
before_agent_start next session:
  - classify current intent
  - retrieve relevant Episodes (context-aware scoring: intent + keyword + success + profile + effectiveness)
  - retrieve relevant Skills and Conventions
  - inject into system prompt
  - track injected episode/skill/convention IDs for feedback
```

## Storage

**Default:** project-local under `<project-root>/.omp/` (memory, evolution DB + projections, skills). This keeps **project isolation** — skills and conventions from one repo do not leak into another.

```
<repo>/.omp/
├── memory/
│   ├── MEMORY.md
│   ├── memory_summary.md
│   ├── raw_memories.md
│   └── rollout_summaries/
├── evolution/
│   ├── evolution.db          # SQLite with WAL + FTS5 (evolution + memory tables)
│   ├── conventions.md
│   ├── system-diagnosis.md
│   ├── user_profile.md
│   ├── activity.log
│   └── evolution_log.md
└── skills/                   # Flat *.md skill exports
```

### Tables in `evolution.db`

Logical groupings inside the single database file:

| Group | Tables |
|---|---|
| Evolution | `episodes`, `episodes_fts`, `skills`, `skill_versions`, `conventions`, `session_traces`, `regression_fixtures`, `regression_trials`, `evolution_escalations`, `episode_intents`, `workflow_patterns`, `user_profiles`, `episode_effectiveness`, `skill_effectiveness`, `episode_detailed_outcomes`, `episode_diagnoses`, `nudge_history`, `fit_scores`, `stats`, … |
| Memory | `threads`, `stage1_outputs`, `jobs`, `vector_embeddings` |

Session transcripts (JSONL) stay in `~/.omp/agent/sessions/`. Auth and CLI settings use `~/.omp/agent/agent.db` — memory/evolution rows are **not** stored there anymore.

**Global user store (default):** `~/.omp/self-evolution/` and encoded paths under `~/.omp/agent/memories/`. Use `--self-evolution-project-store` for `<repo>/.omp/`; `migrate-evolution-data.sh` copies global data into a project tree when needed.

### One-time migration

```bash
bash packages/self-evolution/scripts/migrate-evolution-data.sh /path/to/repo
bun packages/self-evolution/scripts/backfill-episodes-from-sessions.ts --cwd /path/to/repo --per-project
```

### Database Schema Overview

| `workflow_patterns` | Mined tool sequences per intent (occurrence count, avg quality) |
| `user_profiles` | Aggregated behavioral profile (tool frequency, transitions, intent distribution) |
| `episode_effectiveness` | Injection tracking — times injected, helped, failed per episode |
| `skill_effectiveness` | Injection tracking — times injected, helped, failed per skill |
| `conventions` | Project rules — type, content, confidence, violation counters |
| `convention_feedback` | Compliance records — per-session complied/violated with details |

## Activity Log

View recent operations:

```bash
# All events
cat .omp/evolution/activity.log

# Last 20 events
tail -20 .omp/evolution/activity.log

# Pretty-print
cat .omp/evolution/activity.log | jq .
```

Log rotates automatically at 10MB (keeps 3 files).

## Database Queries

**Default DB path:** `<repo>/.omp/evolution/evolution.db`

**Global user store path** (default): `~/.omp/self-evolution/evolution.db`

Use `sqlite3` from the repo root (column names must match current schema):

```bash
DB=.omp/evolution/evolution.db

# Recent episodes
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB" \
  "SELECT substr(user_prompt,1,80) AS prompt, tool_call_count, completed_successfully FROM episodes ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Convention lifecycle (not `status` — use lifecycle_state)
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB" \
  "SELECT lifecycle_state, COUNT(*) FROM conventions GROUP BY lifecycle_state;"

# Regression fixtures (entries live in session_traces.trace_json, not fixtures)
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB" \
  "SELECT dominant_error_tool, COUNT(*) FROM regression_fixtures GROUP BY dominant_error_tool;"

# Episode diagnoses (table is episode_diagnoses, not session_diagnoses)
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB" \
  "SELECT episode_id, dominant_error_tool, dominant_error_pattern FROM episode_diagnoses ORDER BY recorded_at DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Escalations (pattern_key, not pattern_id)
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB" \
  "SELECT id, pattern_key, occurrence_count, status FROM evolution_escalations WHERE status = 'open';"

# Skills with user ratings
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB" \
  "SELECT name, version, quality_score, user_rating FROM skills WHERE deprecated = 0;"

# Fit score trend (empty until /evolution fit has run once)
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB" \
  "SELECT date, total_score, verdict FROM fit_scores ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 5;"
```
